          My name is Ben Laubach. Currently, I am studying full stack web
          development in the University of Washington's coding bootcamp. Feel
          free to take a look around my github for my work, or contact me. I am
          working on a full-stack application for production companies aimed
          towards keeping track of non-conforming products in an easy to see
          manner.
